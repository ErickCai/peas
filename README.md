Python Evolutionary Algorithms
==============================

This is a library of evolutionary algorithms with a focus on _neuroevolution_, implemented in pure python, depending on numpy. It contains a faithful implementation of [Ken Stanley][1]'s **NEAT** (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) and HyperNEAT. The focus of this library is **easy experimentation**, it is pure python so it's easy to set up, and it has a simple and flexible API.
